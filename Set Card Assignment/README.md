**Overview of the Project**
- **The Game:** Explore the engaging world of Set, a game that challenges players to identify sets of three cards based on distinct attributes.
- **The Implementation:** This project enhances the Set game with a multi-threaded approach, adding complexity and interactive depth.

**Summary of Features**
- Advanced multi-threaded gameplay.
- Accommodates up to 2 human players and 4 computer-operated players.
- Configurable gameplay settings via a user-friendly config file.
- Dynamic and real-time user interface.
- Built for easy scalability and updates.

**In-Depth Feature Analysis**
- **Multi-threaded Architecture:** Core components include:
  - **Table:** Central card repository.
  - **Dealer:** Deck management and player interactions.
  - **Player:** Input processing and dealer communication.
  - **AI:** Decision-making for COM players.
  - **UI:** Real-time display and updates.
- **Concurrency Management:** Ensures safe and effective multi-threaded operations using object locks, semaphores, and synchronized functions.
- **Player Configuration:** Supports various configurations of human and COM players, customizable through the config file. COM players can be set to 'random' or 'smart' decision modes.
- **Flexible Configuration:** The config file allows for modifications to gameplay, enhancing the game's adaptability and future-proofing the project.
